Some notes about the log system:
-------------------------------

The functionality can be found in kicost/log.py

We use 3 "domains":
- kicost
- kicost.distributors
- kicost.edas

So we have 3 separated logger objects.
- main_logger: defined in kicost/__init__.py
- distributor_class.logger: defined in kicost/distributors/distributor.py
- eda_class.logger: defined in kicost/edas/eda.py

We also have some wrappers to make the calls simpler, they are defined in:
- kicost/__init__.py for the main_logger
- kicost/distributors/log__.py for the distributor_class.logger
- kicost/edas/log__.py for the eda_class.logger

The three loggers can be configured calling init_all_loggers defined in __main__.py

The log level for debug is split in 10 sub-levels defined in kicost/__init__.py
The wrappers helps to use them.

To avoid circular dependencies kicost/distributors/distributor.py and kicost/edas/eda.py doesn't use the wrappers.

The wrappers are defined in file names like __init__.py and log__.py this is because our logging class can skip the stack frames for these
files and hence print the real line number (and not the line number of the wrapper).
